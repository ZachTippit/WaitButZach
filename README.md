# Blog/Portfolio Site for www.ZachTippit.com

Welcome! This is the public repo for my portfolio site. It is deployed through Netlify on CI.

Check it out at [ZachTippit.com](https://www.zachtippit.com)

## Tech Used

The website was built from scratch using React and Material UI on the front-end. React-router-dom is used for routing. ConvertKit is used for subscriptions, SendGrid for email comms and Contentful as a headless CMS!

## Routes

Just a brief overview of what content you can find on the site!

  > Home: Main landing page, hosts articles, sign up form and quicklinks
  > About: Self-explanatory
  > Articles: Routing page for different published articles
  > Reading List: WIP page to share content that I've found inspiring!
  > Contact: Sign up form either sending a convertkit sign up or Twilio email to me personally.

## Future Inclusions

#### At least as of 1/9/22
Here are just a few things on the radar 
  > Adding analytics
  > Random post button: click on it to go to a random post!
  > Anthology page -- basically an overview router for grouped posts
  > Search functionality across articles
  > Formatting some stuff! The site is getting there but it isn't quite to the polished standard that I'd prefer.
  > Full accessibility implementation.
